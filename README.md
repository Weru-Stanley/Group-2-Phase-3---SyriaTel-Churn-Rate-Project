## Project Overview
Customer churn is when a customer ceases his or her relationship with a company. Syriatel Telcom values its customers and wants to understand what leads some of them to end their relationship with us.

We used binary classification models to predict the customer churn rate at Syria Tel. The primary goal was to identify factors that would highly influence customer attrition in order to help the company reduce financial losses associated with customer churn.

## Problem Statement 
SyriaTel would like to maintain or increase the customer retention rate as well as address the challenge of customer churn by developing an accurate binary classification model that predicts the likelihood of customers discontinuing their services and identifies the factors they should address to reduce attrition.

## Data Science Process Used:
The Data Science Process that is adhered to in this analysis is the CRISP-DM Process.

### 1. Business Understanding
Telcom operators usually consider two main factors in their plan to maintain and increase their business revenue. The first factor is the act of acquisition of new subscribers, and the second factor is the act of retention of the subscribers. In the highly competitive telecommunications sector, customer attrition, or churn, has emerged as a significant concern for businesses like Syriatel. To address churn effectively, telecom businesses must recognize its underlying factors and predict them accurately. Businesses can proactively identify customers at risk of leaving and devise personalized retention strategies. Taking a proactive approach to churn management allows companies to mitigate revenue loss while simultaneously enhancing customer satisfaction.


### 2. Data Understanding

What Data Did We Use?
The SyriaTel Dataset was retrieved from [Kaggle]([https://openai.com](https://www.kaggle.com/becksddf/churn-in-telecoms-dataset)). It contains information on about 3,333 customers. The data includes various details like the state the customer is from, how long they've been a customer, whether they have an international plan or voice mail plan, how many customer service calls they've made, and many more.
