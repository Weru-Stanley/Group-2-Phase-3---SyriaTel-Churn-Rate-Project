## Project Overview
Customer churn is when a customer ceases his or her relationship with a company. The key Stakeholder - Syriatel Telcom, values their customers and wants to understand what leads some of them to end their relationship with us.

We used binary classification models to predict the customer churn rate at Syria Tel. The primary goal was to identify factors that would highly influence customer attrition, in order to help the company reduce financial losses associated with customer churn. 

## Business UNderstanding.
Telcom operators usually consider two main factors in their plan to maintain and increase their business revenue. The first factor is the act of acquisition of new subscribers and the second factor is the act of retention of the subscribers. In the highly competitive telecommunications sector, customer attrition, or churn, has emerged as a significant concern for businesses like SyriaTel. To address churn effectively, telecom businesses must recognize its underlying factors and predict them accurately. Businesses can proactively identify customers at risk of leaving and devise personalized retention strategies. Taking a proactive approach to churn management allows companies to mitigate revenue loss while simultaneously enhancing customer satisfaction.
